A:  00000, 16-bit 	// accumulator (for general computation)
LP: 00001, 16-bit	// lower accumulator (lower product after MP instructions)
Q:  00002, 16-bit 	// return address register (remained from DV and return addr from TC)
EB: 00003, 3-bit	// erasable bank register
FB: 00004, 4-bit	// fixed bank register
Z:  00005, 16-bit 	// next address (aka program counter)
BB: 00006 			// both bank register, maybe the same as Sbank?
